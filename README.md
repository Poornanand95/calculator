## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Basic logic

Input is taken in form of string 
eval() function for strings is used to solve expression.
As eval function does not allow pre decimal zeros, so logic is made to restrict the user to input unnecessary zeros.
App is responsive on mobile devices also.
